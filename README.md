# Computer-Graphics

1. Design a line using DDA line drawing algorithm
2. Implement Bresenham's line drawing algorithm for all types of slope.
3. Design a real world picture using primitive such as points, lines, triangles and polygons.
4. Design, develop and implement recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to form 3D sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user.
5. Design different types of lines using OpenGL built in functions, considering all the attributes and primitives.
6. Design a menu driven program to draw three different polygons using mouse interactions.
7. Implement a circle drawing algorithm.
8. Develop a menu driven program to fill the polygons using scan line algorithm.
9. Implement the program to draw a polygon that interact with input keyboard functions to scale the object.
10. Design a program to use mouse input function to select an endpoint position for a straight-line segment on the screen.
11. Design a program that plots a red-point, with a point-size equal to 3, at the position of the mouse cursor in the display window, each time when you press the left mouse button.
12. Design a bar chart using Recti that show the production of rice in each month of the year in India.
13. Design a 2D object and show the object before and after translation.
14. Design a 2D object and show the object before and after scaling.
15. Create and rotate a triangle about the origin and a fixed point.
